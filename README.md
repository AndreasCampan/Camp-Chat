# Camp-Chat

## Purpose

This is a chat app called **Camp-Chat**! My objective was to build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native.

## What will it do?

The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images as well as their location. Users can enter their name and choose a background colour for the chat screen. Data is stored on the client-side and available when the user is offline.

## Quick Start

- Install [Expo](https://expo.io/): `npm install expo-cli -g`

- For Windows and Linux: Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).<br>

For more information how to set up an emulator, look [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

- For Mac: Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

- Install the Expo app on your mobile device (available in Google Play Store and Apple Store)

## Getting started

Set up your React Native App in your projects folder

```sh

$ expo init hello-world
